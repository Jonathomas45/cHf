Class Structure = this is to help build views of the recipes by different headers in list(intro_view)
that displays: name, total time, ingredients, and nutrition.
Works by placing a recipe name inbetween the parenthesises.

Validate = this function uses the name of the recipe and Validates its in the recipe book.
Snap = this captures the name and index of the recipe.
Display = this is what prints out the view and decides what headers get styled in what way.
Style.Cleanup.indent = this takes the specified header and the associated string then indents the item and puts the next to a newline.
